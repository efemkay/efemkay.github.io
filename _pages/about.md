    Minimal Mistakes is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme. Perfect for hosting your personal site, blog, or portfolio on GitHub or self-hosting on your own server. As the name implies --- styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you :smile:.

    {% include gallery id="layouts_gallery" caption="Examples of included layouts `splash`, `single`, and `archive`." %}

    [Install the Theme]({{ "/docs/quick-start-guide/" | relative_url }}){: .btn .btn--success .btn--large}
