## Global portfolio is a form diversification in term geographical (and even geopolitical)
- Malaysia equity market is a stock picker’s market – you won’t get a positive return (let alone beat the inflation) if you simply invest in all large cap or even top 100 stocks.
	- You may refer to FTSE Bursa Malaysia Index Series report dated 30 June 2022 (link [here](https://research.ftserussell.com/Analytics/FactSheets/temp/58c1469a-bc9f-4c9b-86af-3b7a587e4e75.pdf)) and see that for the past 5 years (ending June 2022) all FBM indices (KLCI, Mid 70, and Small Cap) gives between -3.7% to -4.0% annualised (compounded) on capital return
- Going global is sensible move considering that certain key economies like US, China and India are thriving for the past decade especially when compared to other economies
- However, focusing on any single country will put you on the country risk, plus despite interlinked market in the current globalised economy, some market react differently from others

	- US market were abysmal in 2006 and 2007 before totally tanked in 2008 during [Financial crisis of 2007–2008 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008) (but so do others). But avoiding it would mean losing out tremendous growth from US market since then (averaging 14.7% p.a. for past 10 years 2012-2021)
